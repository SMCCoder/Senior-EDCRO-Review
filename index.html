								<!-- IDEA FOR PRESENTATION:
										 A hand in a fist at the beginning of the presentation, that
										 slowly opens as I progress through the presentation. Put the fist
										 at 'My Beginning.' To get the drawings, take pictures of me signing
										 and turn them into svgs or nicely textured photos in Affinity.
									 -->
								<!-- In presentation, prioritize most important and impactful experiences.
										 Include parts about how I developed my passion for coding and
										 rediscovered Deaf culture.
									 -->

									<h2 class="center-title">Sofie's<br />Senior EDCRO Review</h2>
									<div class="row" align="middle">
										<img class="img-responsive" height="40%" width="40%" data-src="presentation-data/img/senior-photo.jpg" />

								<!-- #2 -->
								<section>
									<h3>My Beginning</h3>
									<p>
										I came to A3 because my parents suggested it. They said it was a good place
										to go to because, it was small, with a welcome community.
									</p>
									<p>
										As a deaf person who needed accomodations, it seemed ideal.
									</p>
									<p>
										At that point, however, I was also anxious in social situations and I had
										no idea what I wanted to do for my carreer. Little did I know, A3 would change
										that.
									</p>
								</section>

								<!-- #3 -->
								<section>
									<h3>My First Headwaters</h3>
									<p>
										I was a shy person when I first came to A3,
									</p>
									<p>
										It was stressful at first, because I was surrounded by people I didn't know,
									</p>
									<p>
										But then I came to know them. They were supportive, and wanted to make sure
										that they could hear me. At the end of it, there was a schoolwide
										conversation where everyone was going up and saying what they liked about
										Headwaters. Nervously, I went up, and thanked everyone for being so willing
										to accomodate me. It was that experience that helped solidify my
										confidence.
									</p>
								</section>

								<section>
									<h3>Learning Coding</h3>
									<p>
										One of my most impactful classes I had was Creative Coding. It made me interested
										in programming and problem-solving, and gave me a direction for my carreer.
									</p>
									<p>
										Before, I didn't have any pacticular interests. However, I found that coding was
										something I wanted to even outside of class.
									</p>
									<p>
										This help set the stage for what was to come.
									</p>
								</section>

								<section>
									<h3>The Internship</h3>
									<p>
										Because my mother knew I was interested in coding, she suggested I apply for
										an internship at the U of O. I applied, and got in.
									</p>
									<p>

									</p>
									<p>
										In the summer of my Junior year, I applied for an internship at the University
										of Oregon, and got in.
