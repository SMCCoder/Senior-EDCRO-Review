								<!-- IDEA FOR PRESENTATION:
										 A hand in a fist at the beginning of the presentation, that
										 slowly opens as I progress through the presentation. Put the fist
										 at 'My Beginning.' To get the drawings, take pictures of me signing
										 and turn them into svgs or nicely textured photos in Affinity.
									 -->
								<!-- In presentation, prioritize most important and impactful experiences.
										 Include parts about how I developed my passion for coding and
										 rediscovered Deaf culture.

										<h3>My Beginning</h3>
										<p>
											Born deaf, I needed hearing aids in order to hear, but I also
											learned sign language.
										</p>
										<p>
											When I was seven, my parents made a tough decision to get me a
											cochlear implant.
										</p>
										<p>
											It helped me hear much better, and I no longer needed and interpeter.
										</p>
										<p>
											However, my ASL began to deteriorate due to a lack of use.
										</p>
									</section>
									<section>
										<h3>Going to A3</h3>
										<p>
											I came to A3 because my parents suggested it. They said it was a good place
											to go to because, it was small, with a welcome community.
										</p>
										<p>
											I was anxious in social situations and I had
											no idea what I wanted to do for my carreer.
										</p>
										<p>
											Hopefully, A3 would help with that.
										</p>

									<h3>My First Headwaters</h3>
									<p>
										It was stressful at first, because I was surrounded by people I didn't know,
									</p>
									<p>
										But then I came to know them, and eventually, I began to feel like I belonged
									</p>
									<p>
										Because of this, I was motivated to thank everyone in a schoolwide conversation,
										and that experience really helped my confidence.
									</p>
								</section>

								<section data-background="presentation-data/img/hand%203.svg">
									<h3>Learning Coding</h3>
									<p>
										One of my most impactful classes I had was Creative Coding.
									</p>
									<p>
										It made me interested in programming and problem-solving
									</p>
									<p>
										This class also gave me a direction for my carreer path.
									</p>
									<p>
										This help set the stage for what was to come.
									</p>

										<h3>The Internship</h3>
										<p>
											Because my mother knew I was interested in coding, she suggested I apply for
											an internship at the U of O. I applied, and got in.
										</p>
										<p>
											During the internship, I learned about how bacterial mutations worked.
										</p>
										<p>
											My mentors had me create a interactive network visualization to help visualize
											the mutations.
										</p>
										<p>
											From this, I learned a lot of new things about coding, and I wanted to share it.

										<h3>Teaching Coding</h3>
										<p>
											My coding teacher invited me to help create his integrated math class by creating
											simulations that involved space, math, and coding.
										</p>
										<p>
											In the process of creating these simulations, I refined my coding skills,
										</p>
										<p>
											And gained experience in teaching

										<p>
											I have also created a new advanced creative class with my coding teacher
											that allows students to learn a multitude of coding languages
										</p>
										<p>
											Additionally, I hope to be able to volunteer for Deaf Kids Code, a program
											that encourages younge deaf kids to do programming

									<h3>Rediscovering ASL</h3>
									<p>
										My teacher suggested that I join an ASL class to fulfill my
										language credit and relearn sign language
									</p>
									<p>
										At that point, my ASL had deteriorated due to a lack of use.
									</p>
									<p>
										I wanted to be able to communicate better and perhaps reconnect,
										so I decided to take it.
									</p>
								</section>

								<section data-background="presentation-data/img/hand%207.svg">
									<h3>The ASL Class</h3>
									<p>
										I learned more ASL and improved my ability to communicate with
										other Deaf people
									</p>
									<p>
										I did a guest speaking where I shared my experiences as a Deaf
										person with the class
									</p>
									<p>
										I learned about the history of Deaf culture, and the challenges
										many Deaf people face.
									</p>
									<p>
										All these things culminated into a strong passion for ASL and
										a great respect for Deaf culture.
									</p>
								</section>

								<section data-background="presentation-data/img/hand%208.svg">
									<h3>The ASL Club</h3>
									<p>
										I wanted to start an ASL club at A3 because I wanted to raise
										awareness about Deaf culture
									</p>
									<p>
										I would do activities and exercises with the students to engage
										them in ASL
									</p>
									<p>
										I also talked about the challenges that Deaf people face now,
										and what they can do to help
									</p>
									<p>
										From this, I learned a lot about teaching, but I also hope that
										I helped more hearing people understand Deaf culture better
									</p>
								</section>

								<section data-background="presentation-data/img/hand%209.svg">
									<h3>The EDX Talk</h3>
									<p>
										In one of my last Confluences, I did a humanitarian subject
										about a Portable Greenhouse. (I had actually inspired this class)
									</p>
									<img style="float: right; margin: 20px;" class="img-responsive" height="30%" width="30%" data-src="presentation-data/img/humanitarianconfluence.jpg" />
									<p>
										I had to do a rehearsed speech with my groupmate, and this was
										stressful.
									</p>
									<p>
										However, after a lot of preperation, it was a success, and I
										became much more confidence in my communication.
									</p>

									<h3>Deciding my Future</h3>
									<p>
										When deciding my college, I wanted to go somewhere with a strong computer
										science focus, but also had a good community.
									</p>
									<p>
										In the end, I chose Rochester Institute as my college, because of it's deaf and hard of
										hearing community.
